# images

its is better to create folder for all of the images that sites uses and orgonize them

**adding images**

< img >

To add an image need to use an < img >
element. and it carry two attributes:

src :  This tells the browser where
it can find the image file

alt : This provides a text description
of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it

title : You can also use the title
attribute with the < img > element
to provide additional information
about the imag

**Height & Width of Images**

height

This specifies the height of the
image in pixels.

width
This specifies the width of the
image in pixels.

Where an image is placed
in the code will affect how it
is displayed. 

Where you place the image in
the code is important because
browsers show HTML elements
in one of two ways:

Block elements always appear
on a new line. 

Inline elements sit within a
block level element and do not
start on a new line


Old Code: Aligning
Images Horizontally Old Code and Aligning
Images Vertically


The align attribute was
 used to indicate how
the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has
been removed from HTML5

3 ways of creating images:
Save images in the right format

save the image right size

Use the correct resolution

**images formates**

 jpeg : Whenever you have many different
colors in a picture you should use a JPEG

gif:Use GIF or PNG format
when saving images
with few colors or large
areas of the same color

**Image Dimensions**

The images you use on your website should be
saved at the same width and height that you
want them to appear on the page.

**Image Resolution**

The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to
a type of image format known
as **bitmap**. They are made up of
lots of miniature squares. 

The resolution of an image is the
number of squares that fit within
a 1 inch x 1 inch square area.

Images appearing on computer
screens are made of tiny squares
called **pixels**. 

**Vector images** : differ from bitmap images and
are resolution-independent. Vector images are
commonly created in programs such as Adobe
Illustrator.

**animated gifs**
Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

**Transparency**
Creating an image that is partially transparent
(or "see-through") for the web involves
selecting one of two formats:
Transparent GIF
If the transparent part of the
image has straight edges and
it is 100% transparent (that is,
not semi-opaque), you can save
the image as a GIF (with the
transparency option selected)


**Contrast**
When picking foreground and background
colors, it is important to ensure that there is
enough contrast for the text to be legible

# text 

Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. 

Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.Monospace

VFantasy

Fantasy fonts are usually decorative fonts and are often used for titles. They're not
designed for long bodies of text.

The font-family property

allows you to specify the
typeface that should be used for
any text inside the element(s) to
which a CSS rule applies.
The value of this property is the
name of the typeface you want
to use.

 There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. The
most common are:

pixels

Pixels are commonly used
because they allow web
designers very precise control
over how much space their text
takes up. The number of pixels is
followed by the letters px.
percentages

ems

An em is equivalent to the width
of a letter m.src
This specifies the path to the
font. 


rgb values
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up.
