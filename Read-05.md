*&& logical and*

 || logical for

*! logical not*

*loops check a condition if it returns true  CODE BLOCK WILL RUN AND THEN CHEDCKED AGAIN IT REPEATS UNTIL THE CONDITION RETURNS FALSE*

***FOR*** *IF YOU NEED TO RUN  CODE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF TIMES USE A FOR LLOOP*

***WHILE*** *IF YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY TIMes the code should run*

*loop counters a for loop uses a counter as a condition*

*it is made of three statements*

***intialization***
*create a variablr and set it to 0 the variable called i and it acts as a contr*

***condition*** *the loop contiue to run untill reaches a specific number*

***update*** *every time  the  loop  has run the statement in the curly braces it adds one to the counter*

the first the loop is run the variable i is assigned a value of zero
every timee the loop is run the condition is checked

then the statement is run
using for loops it is used to loop through the items in an array
